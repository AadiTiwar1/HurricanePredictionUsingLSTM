# Hurricane Windspeed Forecasting using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)


Hurricanes remain as one of the deadliest natural disaster on the planet. Utilizing a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to forecast the windspeeds of future hurricanes, our project aims to develop a unique, effective, and easy-to-use model that allows for various input parameters. To create predictions, you can use our interactive app contains sliders which allow you to precisely enter inputs such as dates to get an output in seconds for the windspeeds and location of the next big hurricane. Based on these predicted results, one can easily determine the severity and category of the predicted hurricane. This repo is inspired from the contents of this [repo](https://github.com/DikshantDulal/SoftServe_QLSTM) which uses LSTM for stock prediction. We utilized the LSTM aspect of the project to Hurricane data and developed different columns with various learning rates and epochs to maximize accuracy.
