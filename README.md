# HurricanePredictionUsingLSTM


This project approaches the devastating natrual phenomenons that are hurricanes and utilizes a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to forecast the windspeeds of future hurricanes given proper input parameters. Our intereactive app contains sliders that allow you to precisely enter inputs and get an output in seconds for the windspeeds of the next big hurricane. This repo is inspired from the contents of this [repo](https://github.com/DikshantDulal/SoftServe_QLSTM) which uses LSTM for stock prediction. We repurposed it to use data from the NOAA and different columns with different learning rates and epochs for the maximized accuracy.
