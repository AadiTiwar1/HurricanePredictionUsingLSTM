# Hurricane Windspeed Prediction using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)


Hurricanes remain one of the deadliest natural disaster on the planet. Utilizing a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to forecast the windspeeds of future hurricanes, our project aims to develop a unique, effective, and easy to use model that allows for various input parameters. Based on these results, one can easily determine the severity and category of the predicted hurricane. This repo is inspired from the contents of this [repo](https://github.com/DikshantDulal/SoftServe_QLSTM) which uses LSTM for stock prediction. We repurposed it to use data from the NOAA and developed different columns with various learning rates and epochs to maximize accuracy. Our interactive app contains sliders that allow you to precisely enter inputs such as dates to get an output in seconds for the windspeeds and location of the next big hurricane.
